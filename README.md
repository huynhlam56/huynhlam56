Hi, I'm Huynh. In 2020, I graduated from San Diego State University. After graduation, I worked as a medical assistant at SD Family Care Center, where I had the privilege of being part of the pediatrics department for two years. It was an incredibly rewarding experience, however I just felt the need to expand my knowledge and learn something new. I always hear my friends talk about coding and software development but never knew what that entailed. So I began my research, and I quickly realized that there's so much about technology that I don't know about. So much behind the scenes that I never even thought about, so it was very intriguing to me. It's fascinating to see how software development is transforming the world we live in, from healthcare to finance and everything in between. And I wanted to be a part of that transformation. Making the decision to pivot and pursue a career in software development was a big leap for me, but I knew that I wanted to take a different path from what I had originally planned. It was then that I discovered App Academy, a turning point where I decided to fully commit to this new journey. The experience has been challenging, yet incredibly rewarding, and I've discovered a liking for coding and building apps, and I never thought of ever being a software developer before. Looking ahead, I am excited to continue learning and creating meaningful projects. Maybe one day I'll have the opportunity to work on a project aimed at enhancing electronic health records, making it more accessible and user-friendly for both patients and healthcare providers. Thatâ€™s my story, thank you for being a part of my ongoing journey.
