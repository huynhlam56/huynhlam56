Hi, I'm Huynh! I graduated from San Diego State University in 2020. After graduation, I worked as a medical assistant at San Diego Family Care, where I had the privilege of being part of the pediatrics department for two years. It was an incredibly rewarding experience, however I just felt the need to expand my knowledge and step out of my comfort zone. 

Driven by curiosity and a desire for growth, I was determined to explore this new journey. Inspired by conversations with friends about coding and software development, I made the bold decision to swap scrubs for syntax and to trade in patient charts for lines of code. This decision led me to App Academy, where I immersed myself in intensive training, acquiring skills in coding and app development. Through dedication and perseverance, I discovered a passion for crafting innovative solutions through code, a world I never envisioned myself exploring before. 

As I look to the future, I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set and adaptability to contribute meaningfully to the constantly changing world of technology. Whether it's developing cutting-edge applications, optimizing user experience, or tackling complex challenges head-on, I am committed to pushing boundaries and creating impactful solutions. 

Thanks for joining me on this wild ride. Here's to chasing dreams and embracing the unknown!
